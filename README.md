Export and import levels as files!

## How it works

There are 2 buttons: Export level, import file. 
The first one converts a level to a .lvl file, which can be shared like any other file,
the other imports such a file and pushes it to the top of your levels list inside Geometry Dash.

For convenience, the program reads your Geometry Dash save file for all level names and puts them
in a selectable list, so you don't have to write it manually.

## Installation
